% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\begin{solution} \hfill \\
Fix $\epsilon > 0$. Suppose for sake contradiction that there exists
a subsequence $\{a_{n_k} x_{n_k}\}$ such that 
\eQb
|p(a_{n_k}x_{n_k})| \geq 2\epsilon \>\>\> (*)
\eQe
for all $k \geq 1$
Since $\{a_n\}$ is bounded, 
passing to a further subsequence, and relabeling, we may suppose that
\eQb
|p(a_{n} x_{n}) | \geq 2\epsilon &\text{and}& \lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = a
\eQe
for any $n \geq 1$ and for some $a \in \mathbb{R}$. 
Now, observe that $\phi_k:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by 
\eQb
\lambda &\mapsto& |p(\lambda x_k)| \>\>\> (\lambda \in \mathbb{R})
\eQe
for each $k \geq 1$ is continuous by (ii). Therefore,  
\eQb
F_n &=& \bigcap_{k=n}^{\infty} {\phi_k}^{-1}([-\epsilon,\epsilon])
\eQe
is closed for each $n \geq 1$ ($F_n$ given in the hint). 
By assumption and (iii), it follows that
\eQb
\bigcup_{n} F_n &=& \mathbb{R}
\eQe 
and by Baire-Category, we can choose $n_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ such that there
exists $\lambda_0 \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\delta > 0$ such that 
\eQb
B(\lambda_0,\delta) \subset F_{n_0}.
\eQe
Now, by (i), we obtain
\eQb
p(a_k x_k) &\leq& p((\lambda_0 + a_k - a) x_k) + p((a - \lambda_0) x_k) 
\eQe
and
\eQb
-p(a_k x_k) &\leq& -p((\lambda_0 + a_k - a) x_k) + p((\lambda_0 - a)x_k)
\eQe
for each $k \geq 1$. Now for all $k$ large enough, since $(a - \lambda_0), 
(\lambda_0 - a)$
are fixed constants, we have
\eQb
(\lambda_0 + a_k - a) \in B(\lambda_0,\delta) \>\>\> \text{and} \>\>\> 
|p((a- \lambda_0)|,|p(\lambda_0 - a)| < \epsilon
\eQe
so
\eQb
|p(a_k x_k)| &<& 2\epsilon,
\eQe
which contradicts $(*)$. By (i), $p(0) \leq 2p(0)$, and $p(0) \leq p(x_n) + 
p(-x_n) $ for all $n \geq 1$, so $p(0) \leq 0$. Therefore, $p(0) = 0$.

Define a map $T$ on $E$ by 
\eQb
x \mapsto T_x \>\>\> \text{with} \>\>\> <T_x,y> = a(x,y).
\eQe
By (i), $T_x$ is bounded for all $x \in E$, so $T$ maps $E$
into $F^*$. We now show that $T$ is bounded. 
Fix $y \in F$. Observe that
\eQb
\{ <Tx,y> \> : \> x \in B_{E}(0,1) \} &=& \{ a(x,y) \> : \> x \in B_E(0,1) \}
\eQe
is bounded by (ii). Therefore, by Corollary 2.5, which follows from
Uniform boundedness principle, $T$ is bounded. 
Now, by the boundedness of $T$, there 
exists $C > 0$ such that
\eQb
\sup_{y \in F; ||y|| \neq 0} \dfrac{|a(x,y)|}{||y||} = ||T_x|| \leq C||x||
\eQe
for any $x \in E$, and hence
\eQb
a(x,y) \leq C ||x|| ||y||
\eQe
for any $x \in E$ and $y \in F$. \hfill $\qed$

\begin{solution} \hfill \\
Suppose that $T(M)$ is closed. Then, by continuity of $T$,
\eQb
M + N(T) = T^{-1}(T(M)) \>\>\> \text{is closed}.
\eQe
Conversely, suppose that $M + N(T)$ is closed. We contend that
\eQb
T((M + N(T))^c) = T(M)^c. \>\>\> (*) 
\eQe 
Let $x \in T(M + N(T)^c)$. Then, there exists $y \in (M + N(T))^c$, 
such that $T(y) = x$. Suppose for sake of contradiction that $x \in T(M)$. 
Then, there exists $x_0 \in M$, such that $T(x_0) = y$, and by linearity of $T$,
$x - x_0 \in N(T)$, so $x \in M + N(T)$, a contradiction. 
For the other inclusion, let $x \in T(M)^c$. By surjectivity of $T$,
there exists $z \in E$ such that $T(z) = x$. Suppose for sake of contradiction
that $z = m + n$ with some $m \in M$ and $n \in N(T)$. By linearity of $T$,
\eQb
x = T(z) = T(m), 
\eQe 
which contradicts that $x \in T(M)^c$. Therefore, (*) is true.
To conclude, observe that,
by open mapping theorem, $T(M)^c$ is open, so $T(M)$ is closed.
Now, (ii) follows from the problem 5 and (i). \hfill $\qed$

\textbf{(1)}
Let $\tilde{E} = E / N(T)$, $\pi$ be the canonical quotient map,
and $\tilde{T}:E / N(T) \to F$ such that $T = \tilde{T} \circ \pi$.
From definition, we know that $\tilde{T}$ is linear, injective, and $R(T) 
= R(\tilde{T})$. 

\smallskip

Suppose the given estimate holds. We claim that $R(\tilde{T})$ is closed, then by 
$R(T) = R(\tilde{T})$, we will be done. Observe that 
\eQb
||[x]|| = d(x,N(T)) \leq C||Tx|| = C||\tilde{T}[x]|| (*)
\eQe  
for all $x \in E$. Suppose $\{y_n\} \subset R(\tilde{T})$ such that $y_n \to y$ for some
$y$. Then, there exists 
$\{[x_n]\} \subset \tilde{E}$. By the above estimate, $\{[x_n]\}$ is
cauchy, and by continuity $\tilde{T}[x_n] \to \tilde{T}[x]$ where $[x]$ is the
limit of $\{[x_n]\}$. Therefore, $R(\tilde{T})$ is closed. 

Suppose $R(T)$ is closed. Then, $R(\tilde{T})$ is closed, and hence Banach.
Since $\tilde{T}$ is bijective, by Corollary 2.7, $\tilde{T}^{-1}$ is continuous so 
we again have (*).

\bigskip

\textbf{(2)} Consider $D(A)$ with graph norm. Then, as $A$ is closed, $D(A)$ is 
Banach. Since graph norm only increases the norm from each norm, $T$ is bounded
and by (1) we are done.



\end{solution}

\begin{solution} \hfill \\
Let $\pi$ be the canonical projection of $E$ onto $E / G$. As $L$
is finite dimensional space, we see that $\pi(L)$ is finite dimensional, hence
closed.  
By continuity of $\pi$, it follows that $\pi^{-1}(\pi(L)) = G + L$ is closed.

\bigskip

Suppose $G+L$ admits a complement $A$ in $E$. Since $G \cap L$ is finite dimensional,
it admits a complement $B$ in $L$. $A+B$ is closed by (i). 
We claim that $A +B$ is the complement of $G$. If $g \in A+B \cap G$, then
$g = a+b$ for some $b \in B$ and $a \in A$. By re-arranging, we see that 
$a = 0$ and $g = 0$. Therefore, it follows that for any $x \in A$, we can express it
as an unique sum of an element in $A+B$ and $G$, so $A+B$ is a complement of $G$.



\bigskip

Suppose $G$ admits a complement $H$ in $E$. Let $\pi_G$ and $\pi_H$ be canonical  
projections of $G$ and $H$ respectively. Observe that
$\pi_H(L)$ is finite dimensional, so it admits a complement $A \subset H$
in $H$. We claim that $A$ is a complement of $G + L$. Note that $A$ is closed
trivially. Suppose $x \in A \cap G+L$. Then, $x = g+l$ for some $g \in G$ 
and $l \in L$. By projection properties, one can see that $x = 0$, and again 
see that $x$ can be written as a unique sum of an element in $G+L$ and $A$
which completes the proof. \hfill $\qed$

For convenience, we identify $\mathbb{T}$ with $[0,2\pi]$ and consider $0$ as the point,
where we study the divergence.
Let $\{\phi_n\}$ be a collection of continuous, linear functionals (standard property
of Fourier series), defined on $C(\mathbb{T})$ given by 
\eQb
\phi_n(f) &=& S_n(f,0)
\eQe
for all $f \in C(\mathbb{T})$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Suppose for a moment that
$\{\phi_n\}$ are not uniformly bounded. Then, by uniform boundedness principle,
there exists $f \in C(\mathbb{T})$ such that $\{\phi_n(f)\}$ is not bounded. 

We now show that $\{|\phi_n|\}$
is not bounded. Since $|\sin(t)| \leq t$
for any $t \in [0,2\pi]$, 
\eQb
\int_{0}^{2\pi} |\dfrac{\sin(n+\frac{1}{2})x}{\sin(\frac{x}{2})}| dx &\geq&
\int_{0}^{2\pi} |\sin(n + \frac{1}{2})x| \frac{2}{x} dx = \int_{0}^{2\pi(n+\frac{1}{2})}
|\sin(x)| \dfrac{2}{x} dx \\
&\geq& \sum_{k=1}^{n} \dfrac{1}{k} \int_{2\pi(k-1)}^{2\pi k} |\sin(x)|dx \geq 
\sum_{k=1}^{n} \dfrac{1}{k}  
\eQe
for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. 
The above estimate shows that the $L^1$ norms of the n-th Dirichlet kernels associated 
with $\phi_n$ diverges to $\infty$. Now, it is well-known 
that the functional norm of $\phi_n$
is exactly the $L^1$ norm of the n-th Dirichlet kernel for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.
This can be formally shown by considering the sign of the kernel as the continuous
function, and using DCT to swap the order of limit and integration.

By Tonelli's theorem and the translation invariance property of Lebesgue measure,

||f * g|| &=& \int_{0}^{2\pi} |\int_{0}^{2\pi} f(t - x)g(x) dx | dt
